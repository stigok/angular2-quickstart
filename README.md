## Install

    git clone https://github.com/stigok/angular2-quickstart
    cd angular2-quickstart
    npm install
    npm start

## Working with TypeScript

I was new to TypeScript before looking on Angular2. The Atom plugin [atom-typescript](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript) made transitioning easy with built-in linting, auto-complete and more.

    npm install atom-typescript
